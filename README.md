Hello! 

Text Adventure Creator is a tool that allows you to create a text-based adventure game!

This project is made in python, and it uses it's own custom language to create text-based adventure games. For documentation on how to use it, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/RAMENtheNOODLES/text-adventure-creator/wiki). TAC will continue to be updated whenever I have time. 

If you would like to try it out, please check out the [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RAMENtheNOODLES/text-adventure-creator/HEAD), but keep in mind that it only allows a certain amount of traffic. Instructions on how to [install](https://github.com/RAMENtheNOODLES/text-adventure-creator/wiki/install) the tool will be added in the future.
